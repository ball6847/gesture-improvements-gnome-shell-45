# Gesture Improvement for Gnome Shell 45

A temporary solution for https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4245/gesture-improvements/ to make it work with gnome-shell 45 until it got fixed on the official extension. You can track down the issue here https://github.com/harshadgavali/gnome-gesture-improvements/issues/206 . Before that happen, this repo is your friend.

## Getting started

Just download the extension from release page and install it from zip

```shell
wget https://github.com/ball6847/gesture-improvements-gnome-shell-45/releases/download/25.0/gestureImprovements@gestures.zip
gnome-extensions install -f gestureImprovements@gestures.zip
```

Then logout and login again
